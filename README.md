# OpenCV-BorderDetection-Android
Smart border detection using Java in Android

This is just a POC i made to show how OpenCV can be used to detect borders of a document and crop it display it on the screen 

I spent lot of time in doing this but the challenge was with using OpenCV Java and not by using JNI,

Lot of optimization has been done for memory allocation on time,

If anyone can optimize the code even more it will be of great help to others who may need
